In JavaScript, the choice between using `export default function` and `export function` for module exports does not directly affect the bundle size in any significant way. However, it's important to understand the difference between the two and how they might indirectly influence the structure and potentially the size of your project's codebase.

### 1. `export default function`

This syntax is used to define a default export for a module. Each module can only have one default export. Default exports are useful when a module is designed to export a single main functionality. For example:

```javascript
// In a file myFunction.js
export default function () {
  console.log("This is a default exported function");
}
```

To import this function in another file, you would typically use:

```javascript
import myFunction from "./myFunction";
```

### 2. `export function`

This syntax is used to export functions, variables, or classes that are named exports from a module. A module can have multiple named exports. This is useful for exporting several functions or components from a single module. For example:

```javascript
// In a file utilityFunctions.js
export function functionOne() {
  console.log("This is function One");
}

export function functionTwo() {
  console.log("This is function Two");
}
```

To import these functions, you would use:

```javascript
import { functionOne, functionTwo } from "./utilityFunctions";
```

### Impact on Bundle Size

- **Direct Impact**: The choice between default and named exports doesn't inherently make a difference in the final bundle size because both approaches simply define how symbols are exported and imported. The actual content and number of imports/exports might more significantly influence the bundle size.

- **Indirect Impact**: If using named exports leads to importing more code than necessary (for example, if you import a module just to use one small function out of many large functions), it could potentially increase the bundle size. Conversely, if modularizing code efficiently, each part can be imported separately as needed, which can help in tree shaking (removing unused code) and potentially reduce the bundle size.

- **Tooling**: Modern bundlers like Webpack, Rollup, or tools like Babel have optimizations like tree shaking, which work best with named exports because they can statically analyze which imports are used in a project. This static analysis can be less effective with default exports, especially when the exports are complex objects or functions.

In summary, while the export syntax itself doesn't directly change the bundle size, your overall approach to modularization, importing, and exporting can affect the efficiency and size of your final JavaScript bundle.
